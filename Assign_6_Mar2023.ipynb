Descriptive statistics provides a way to understand and communicate the main features of a dataset, such as the central tendency (mean, median, mode), variability (range, standard deviation), and the shape of the distribution (symmetric, skewed). Descriptive statistics are used to provide a summary of the dataset, without making any inferences about the population from which the dataset was drawn.Ex: Suppose we have a dataset that contains the heights in cm of all students in a class. We can use descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset by calculating the mean height, the median height, the standard deviation, and creating a histogram or box plot to visualize the distribution of the heights."

Suppose we want to estimate the average height of all students in a school, but we cannot measure the height of every student. We can take a random sample of students and use inferential statistics to estimate the average height of the population based on the sample. We might use a confidence interval or a hypothesis test to determine the range of possible values for the population mean height."
