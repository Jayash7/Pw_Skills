    "> The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that evaluates the relevance of features based on their statistical properties without involving any machine learning algorithms. It works by applying statistical tests to each feature to measure its relationship with the target variable. Features are ranked based on these tests, and those that meet a certain criterion (such as a threshold score) are selected.\n",

    "> **Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the linear relationship between the feature and the target variable. Common methods include Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation.\n",

    "> The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it involves training and evaluating a model using subsets of features to determine which features contribute the most to the model's performance.

    "\n",
    "> Evaluation: Wrapper methods use the actual performance of a machine learning model to evaluate feature subsets, whereas Filter methods rely on statistical measures.\n",

    "> Computational Cost: Wrapper methods are computationally more expensive as they require training and testing models multiple times, while Filter methods are faster since they do not involve model training.\n",
