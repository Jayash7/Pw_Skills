      "source": ">Overfitting occurs when our machine learning model tries to cover all the data points or more than the required data points present in the given dataset. Because of this, the model starts caching noise and inaccurate values present in the dataset, and all these factors reduce the efficiency and accuracy of the model. The overfitted model has low bias and high variance.\nUnderfitting occurs when our machine learning model is not able to capture the underlying trend of the data. To avoid the overfitting in the model, the fed of training data can be stopped at an early stage, due to which the model may not learn enough from the training data.\nThe consequences of overfitting and underfitting can be quite significant. Overfitting can lead to a model that performs well on the training data, but poorly on new data, which is the ultimate goal of a machine learning model. Underfitting can lead to a model that performs poorly both on the training data and new data.\nTo mitigate overfitting, one approach is to use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, which add a penalty term to the loss function to discourage overfitting. Another approach is to use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model on new data, and to tune the hyperparameters of the model to find the best balance between overfitting and underfitting.\nTo mitigate underfitting, one approach is to increase the complexity of the model, either by using a more sophisticated algorithm or by adding more features to the model. Another approach is to collect more data to better capture the underlying patterns or relationships.\n",
